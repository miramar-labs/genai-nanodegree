    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### OpenAI Token Limits\n",
    "Model usage on OpenAI is priced by the token, and each model supports a limited number of tokens. You can view this limit under the \"max request\" column on the [OpenAI documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) about any given model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, the demo videos use the text-davinci-003 model, which has a limit of about 4,000 tokens. That limit includes both the custom prompt and the response generated by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note on Model Updates\n",
    "OpenAI moves fast and frequently changes the available models. This course was created using text-davinci-003, but that model has now been deprecated. The updated workspaces use gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct instead. gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct also has a training cutoff of September 2021 and has a token limit of 4,096 tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Counting Tokens\n",
    "Our Goal: Maximizing Context\n",
    "What is the maximum amount of context we can include? The model limit minus the number of tokens in the prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the limit is 4,097 tokens and the prompt contains 24 tokens, the maximum token count for the context will be 4,097 - 24 = 4,073.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Python to Count Tokens\n",
    "In our code, we'll use tiktoken, OpenAI's tokenizer, to count the number of tokens in a piece of text. Here's a basic example that will display the number of tokens in a string:\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Generic example code (not needed for this tutorial)\n",
    "    import tiktoken\n",
    "    tokenizer = tiktoken.get_encoding(\"cl100k_base\")\n",
    "    len(tokenizer.encode(\"Answer the question based on the context\"))"
