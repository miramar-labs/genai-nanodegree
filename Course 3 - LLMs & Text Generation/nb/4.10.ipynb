    "### Loading the Data into a DataFrame\n",
    "Before we use our data, we need to get the data and make sure it is in a form we can use. There are a lot of ways to do that, but in this course, we will use a [pandas DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/dsintro.html#dataframe).\n",

    "We want to set up our DataFrame called df so there is only one column, \"text\". Each row will contain one snippet of text.\n",
