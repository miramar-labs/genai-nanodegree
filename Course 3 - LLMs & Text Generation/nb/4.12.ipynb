    "### Text Embeddings\n",
    "Embeddings are a sophisticated technique for converting text into vectors of numbers using a pre-trained machine learning model. Instead of each number in the vector indicating the presence or absence of a word, **each number in the vector represents a dimension identified by the model**. All text samples result in the same number of columns and we can therefore compare any two text datasets based on their embeddings!\n",

    "- Purpose: Takes raw data (e.g., text, images) as input and produces dense vector representations (embeddings)\n",
