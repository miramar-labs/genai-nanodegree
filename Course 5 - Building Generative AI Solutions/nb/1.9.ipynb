    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to start designing applications that leverage Generative AI is by designing prompt templates. In this exercise, you'll explore creating them This a crucial first step in creating applications or software features that use large language models (LLMs) for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Prompt templates establish how users will interact with the application. They define the structure and format of the input needed for the LLM to generate useful and relevant outputs.\n",
    "- The effectiveness of an LLM is heavily dependent on the quality and specificity of the prompts it receives. Well-designed prompt templates guide the LLM to produce outputs that are directly relevant to the tasks or content in the application.\n",
    "- Prompt templates are integral to the user experience. They help in creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface. By clearly indicating what input is needed and how it should be structured, you are able to quickly prototype and develop a user interface to collect the input that is required.\n",
    "- Prompt templates help in setting realistic expectations for what the LLM can and cannot do. They guide users in how to phrase their requests or inputs to get the best possible response from the AI.\n",
    "- Developers can design systems that are both scalable and flexible. Templates allow for the easy modification and expansion of AI functionalities as new use cases arise or as the LLM's capabilities evolve.\n",
    "- By structuring the input in a standardized format, prompt templates reduce the likelihood of errors and misunderstandings that can arise from ambiguous or poorly formatted user inputs. This is particularly important in applications where precision and accuracy are critical.\n",
    "In the notebook below, you'll develop a prompt template.\n",

    "### Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine an application designed to aggregate and summarize restaurant reviews. Users input the name of a restaurant and the type of cuisine, and the application uses these inputs to generate a summary of the most common sentiments found in various online reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a prompt template that instructs the LLM to generate a concise summary based on the restaurant name and cuisine type.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the User Inputs: Identify what user inputs are needed. For our scenario, these are:\n",
    "    - Restaurant Name\n",
    "    - Cuisine Type\n",
    "- Create the Prompt Template: Design a prompt that incorporates these inputs. Use brackets to show where the inputs will be injected.\n",
    "- Craft the Prompt: Write a clear, concise instruction for the LLM. The goal is to generate a summary of reviews for a specified restaurant and cuisine.\n",
