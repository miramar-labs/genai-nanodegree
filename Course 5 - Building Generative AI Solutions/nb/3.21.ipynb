    "### ConversationBufferMemory\n",
    "The **ConversationBufferMemory** component is essential for maintaining a history of chat messages, enabling the chatbot to have a contextual understanding of the ongoing conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When a user sends a message, it is added to the conversation history, and similarly, the chatbot's responses are also recorded. This helps in providing context for the chatbot's subsequent messages.\n",
    "- The conversation buffer memory can output the chat history either as a continuous stream or as a list.\n",
    "- The stored string of chat messages provides essential context for the language model (LM) when generating its next message.\n",
    "### Highlights of the Demo\n",
    "The demo above presents a guide on creating a basic chatbot using a conversation chain with memory. This was executed in the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Initialization - The chatbot is set up in the standard manner.\n",
    "- Conversation Chain with Memory - A conversation chain is created, featuring an embedded conversation buffer.\n",
    "- Function of the Memory Buffer - This buffer automatically records all user queries and the chatbot's responses, creating a continuous dialogue between the human user and the AI.\n",
    "### Example Use Case\n",
    "- The chatbot is first asked about Paris and it provides a description.\n",
    "- The user then asks how to get there from New York, without mentioning Paris again\n",
    "### Importance of Full Conversation History\n",
    "- Despite the lack of explicit reference to Paris in the second query, the chatbot correctly interprets it as a question about traveling from New York to Paris.\n",
    "- This accuracy is attributed to the chatbot having access to the entire conversation history, not just the last question."
