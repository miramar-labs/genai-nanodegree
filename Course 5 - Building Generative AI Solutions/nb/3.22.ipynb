    "![](./img/img11.png)\n",
    "- Purpose - Allows dynamic, non-deterministic sequences of operations based on previous step outputs.\n",
    "- Application - Adapts interactions with a large language model based on context or question type.\n",
    "- Example - A chatbot handling customer inquiries about electronics, software, and home appliances. It identifies the inquiry type and routes to the appropriate response mechanism.\n",
    "#### Sequential Chain\n",
    "![](./img/img10.png)\n",
    "- Purpose - Facilitates a series of operations where the output of one is the input for the next.\n",
    "- Application - Useful for processes needing multiple language model calls or functions in a specific order.\n",
    "- Example - Creating a product description followed by generating a review using that description.\n",
    "#### Transformation Chain\n",
    "![](./img/img12.png)\n",
    "- Purpose - Involves altering or processing inputs at various points in an operational sequence.\n",
    "- Application - Used to create pipelines for specific tasks.\n",
    "- Example - Extracting video transcripts, stripping timestamps, and then summarizing the text.\n",
    "Each of these chains serves a distinct purpose, enabling more sophisticated and context-sensitive applications of AI models in various scenarios."
